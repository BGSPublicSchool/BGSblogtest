World No Tobacco Day is observed across the globe on May 31 every year. It is aimed at encouraging people to abstain from consuming tobacco for 24 hours and also for raising awareness about the hazardous effects of tobacco consumption on a person's health and well-being. At BGS Public School the staff and students took part in a rally to create awareness in the neighbouring areas.Students carried slogans like “ Quit tobacco, live longer”, “Down Down Cigarattes”, etc. Students made posters and displayed it during the rally which received lot of appreciation from the general crowd. The day was successfully completed with all of them taking a pledge to stay away from tobacco.
