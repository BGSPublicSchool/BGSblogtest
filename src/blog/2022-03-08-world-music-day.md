“Music is the universal language of Mankind.”
“Where words fail music speaks.”
World Music Day was celebrated in our school with the significance of the music day by the students. Various musical instruments like Flute, Violin, Tabla and Harmonium were played by the students including Hindustani Vocal.
Music Day would be nothing without music and although all events that are part of music day provided a great opportunity for budding musicians of all ages, amateur or professional. Music can change the world because it can change people.
