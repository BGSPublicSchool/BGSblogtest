PLANT A TREE
PLANT A LIFE
Every year world environment day is celebrated in the school on June 5th to create the awareness to save preserve and protect the environment.
Students received saplings from the school to take home to Nurture Nature for a better future.  The school reverberated with the slogans :
“Start today Save tomorrow”
“Clean up our Climate “
“Clean up the World “
“Let the peace of Nature flow in your life on world environment day and always”.
The day ended with a note “A beautiful world starts with you, save paper, save trees, save the planet.”
GO GREEN
THINK GREEN
LIVE GREEN &
LOVE GREEN
